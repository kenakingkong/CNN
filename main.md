## What is a Neural Artistic Style Transfer?

Neural artistic style transfer is a method of recreating images in the style of other images, by use of a neural network. The images are not merged together. Essentially, you alter a picture as though someone else created it - as if an image's type is casted onto a different image. 

I should spin off of the existing projects. I can write a better algorithm or script for it - but I doubt that I am smart enough. Or I can make it do something different and specialized - like faces only. I can turn the face into a different landscape.
