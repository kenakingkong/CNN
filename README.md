# CNN Research

**This repostory is a collection of my notes on the subject and my thought process as I dive deep into the deep learning industry and convolutional neural networks.**

## Summary
I like to consider myself equal parts programmer and artist. I don't think people exericise their both left and right brain as much as they ought to. Aside from Web Development, I don't think I've found any topic or project that has integrated the art and creative world with technology as Neural Artistc Style Transfer Projects have.

I didn't know much (or anything for that matter) about neural networks. I've dabbled with some machine learning with Jupyter Notebooks and the SkLearn kit in my data science class. However, I came across a few projects, like [CODAME](http://codame.com/events/workshop-visual-strategies-for-neural-artistic-style-transfer), and I became obsessed with the idea of Neural Artistic Style Transfer. I'm not sure if I am capable of learning or mastering this subject on my own, but I'm still going to try.
