# SENIOR PROJECT : Neural Artistic Style Transfer
## VOCABULARY
[<- main](./main.md)

* **gpu:** graphic processing unit, circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate creation of images in frame buffer
* **neural network:** a computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system
* **artificial intelligence:** a computer system able to perform tasks that require human intelligence
* **machine learning:** an a.i. that adjusts responses to the given data; a computer system that can learn without being programmed
* **deep learning:** a set of algorithms that produce a more intense machine learning computer system
* **universal approximation theorem:** a feed-forward network with a signle hidden layer containing a finite number of neurons can approximate continous functions on compact subsets of R^n - neural networks can represent a wide variety of functions depending on the parameters
* **clustering:** grouping, the detection of similarities
* **unsupervised learning:** learning without labels
* **linear regression:** linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (dependent variable) and 1+ explanatory vairables (independent variables)
* **overfitting:** model has learned more features than we desire
* **interpretability:** ability to understand why some inputs give some outputs
* **backpropagation:** algorithm to calculate a gradient needed in calculating the weights to be used in artificial neural networks
* **gradient descent:** repeatedly nudging an input of a function by multiple of negative gradient to converge toward a local minimum of a cost function
